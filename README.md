There exists a number of well-documented and opensource object recognition modules. These AI-based modules can be used to detect various objects which can be found in common living spaces of people. The information about the detected objects can be used by a robot or can be used in creation of AR models of the human robot environment. For example, when a camera detects an object in front of a robot, this information can be used by the robot to pick-up the object. These modules can be deployed on any recent standard computer hardware.
